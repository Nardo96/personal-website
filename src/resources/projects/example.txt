# Personal Static Site Generator
@ https://github.com/Nardo96/personal-website
- This website is designed such that I can easily add more content to the existing structure by writing to text files in a very simple markup language. I then use React / Next.js to write the code needed to take those text files, parse the content, and statically generate the html and css files needed to load website.
