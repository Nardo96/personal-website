- 
- The christmas present
- Tokyo got that day
- was death and destruction.
- "Whatever..."
- I muttered thoughtlessly.
- The Overlook Floor was
- bustling with tourists and couples, among others.
- Constructed with great fanfare to 35 floors above ground,
- this building was one of Tokyo's latest hotspots.
- "What's so fun about this?"
- Coming to Shinjuku to shop
- was her idea.
- Though I didn't have a reason to refuse,
- I didn't want to go either.
- Shuffled about by the crowd, 
- I felt only a deepening sense of exhaustion.
- What's the point of something like this?
- (Just what...)
- (What will it take before I'm satisfied...?)
- On one hand were such self-deprecating thoughts.
- I would always be somewhat irritated,
- like I had some sort of complaint.
- Yet, as to just what I was irritated by,
- how I could get over it, and the like?
- I didn't have a single clue.
- (Maybe there's nothing in me.)
- Nothing to believe in.
- Nothing to chase after.
- Nothing to love-
- "...huh?"
- A ringtone.
- My cellphone screen showed a newly arrived email.
- The sender... had no name.
- And written in the message was just one thing:
- 
- "Will you decide?"
- 
- Attached to the email was a file.
- "What... is this -"
- I opened the file.
- D.I.O. system, compile, link...
- "I'm back!"
- Abruptly, the woman returned, having bought a drink.
- "Do you want coke or orange juice?"
- she asked with a carefree smile.
- With a dampened demeanor, 
- I closed my cellphone,
- turned around, and tried to respond. It was then -
- 
- Flash!
- 
- Several minutes earlier.
- Atop a screen surveilling the Tokyo airspace,
- countless dots of light suddenly lit up.
- "What the hell is this?!"
- "I- I don't know...
- but... they seem like missiles, sir."
- "Missiles?"
- "Yes... most likely... ICBM..."
- "Bullshit!
- Why'd something like that not show up until now?!"
- "That...just now, all of a sudden...
- it was like they just suddenly appeared in midair..."
- "What are the Americans at Yokohama doing?!"
- The bellows blended together, the self defence force in shambles.
- As if to laugh at them,
- the light atop the radar screen turned
- and launched towards the capital.
- Anyone could see it. They couldn't make it in time.
- And thus, Tokyo was forever illuminated, 
- as all things disappeared into a curtain of nuclear light.
- Anything caught in that burning light
- would melt and evaporate.
- All the while holding millions of people,
- the city of Tokyo was struck by a hot gale
- leading to the total collapse
- of the skyscrapers crowding about.
- Countless bodies were swept away,
- alive, yet burning, as vehicles scattered by
- in every wrong direction, 
- like children throwing toys away.
- Asphalt was upturned.
- Traffic lights lay helplessly melted together.
- Window glass had all turned to dust.
- The screams, the death throes, the voices calling out names,
- all were drowned out by thundorous roaring.
- December 24, 201X --
- 
- The flames of nuclear war burned Tokyo to the ground. 
- In an instant, the capital was brought to a halt, 
- and an innumerable amount of lives
- was mercilessly taken. Simultaneously,
- an electromagnetic pulse born from the explosion 
- destroyed the capital's electrical grid, 
- wiping out what remained of Tokyo's information systems.
- The young pair was no exception. 
- All thought was swallowed up by light, their fields of view stolen,
- bodies floating in the air like leaves.
- A torrid wind struck against their skin.
- Like stones, 
- bits of debris came bumping towards them, 
- along with the sounds of roars, screams, cave-ins, and explosions. 
- Then...
- Silence.
- Surrounded by rubble
- were the bloody, dust-laden figures of 
- those who narrowly survived.
- And they watched on 
- to see the shadows of countless monsters within the flames.
- Above the ruins of Tokyo, 
- beings that once existed only in myths and legends, 
- now furnished with flesh and blood, 
- strode across a mountain of corpses.
- As if to loudly herald 
- the end of Man.
- Seemingly being summoned by something,
- they headed towards that place.
- That is,
- given that all other buildings had crumbled away, 
-  towards that still-towering edifice.
- It just may have been
- a present day Tower of Babel.
- Just...
- how long had it been...?
- I rose amongst the debris, 
- and from across a wrecked window, 
- I saw a closed sky past
- low, drooping, ash-colored clouds.
- Lightning rumbled in the distance.
- "What... the hell's happened...?"
- Surrounding me were what seemed to be
- ruins from a movie.
- Either that, or an active warzone.
- Even though until just before now, 
- it would have been peacefully buzzing with
- people and conversation.
- Surrounded by rubble, 
- I spotted a familiar hoodie.
- On an outstretched fingertip sharply shone
- a ring that we had
- bought together at some point.
- "......"
- Her death was clear for any to see.
- A fallen beam had pierced her back 
- like a steel grave marker, 
- firmly planting her to that spot.
- Through the wreckage, 
- rivers of blood oozed away.
- Yet, as if my heart had died,  
- no feelings arose at all.
- Why...? Even though my lover died...
- Not a single tear would come out.
- Huh.
- So that's it.
- That's the sort of person I am.
- It's not that I didn't love her.
- Nor that I didn't care.
- It's just... inside me, probably...
- there's something definitively broken.
- I grasped my staggering head, 
- and started dragging my aching legs away.
- At the very least, I had to get out of here.
- I don't know what happened, but...
- That moment,
- from my jean's back pocket, 
- my phone flickered with a dodgy light.
- It seemed like something's heartbeat.
- Or maybe even, a pulse...
- fomenting the end of the world.
