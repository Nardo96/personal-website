# Chapter 3
- -15F-
- 
- Bartender:
- "So you're the guy who's been
- making his way down the building, huh.
- I'll tell you something good.
- It seems there's a sword that grows as you fuse it
- with certain demons.
- The Grass-Cutting Sword, or the Spirit Sword, or something...
- If you have it, you should unequip it
- and take it to the Cathedral of Shadows."
- 
- -14F-
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "!?"
- 
- As soon as I entered the room, 
- a strong, sudden light stole my field of vision.
- As if a sun had come down right on top of me, 
- eyes shut from the glare, 
- I felt a warmth spread throughout my face.
- Just what...?
- 
- ?:
- "(Protagonist Name)."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Who... are you?"
- 
- The light dimmed greatly, and eventually, 
- I could see what lay in front of me.
- A man was standing there, 
- tall, copper-skinned, 
- and with an intrepid look about him.
- On his back, 
- behind polished armor...
- spanned a pair of 
- dazzlingly beautiful wings.
- He seemed wrapped 
- in a glaring light.
- 
- ?:
- "I am Michael, leader of angels."
- 
- It was a voice dripping with pride and confidence.
- 
- Michael:
- "(Protagonist Name).
- Did you not heed my warning from last time?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Warning?"
- Michael:
- "You should have heard from Gabriel
- to not be tricked by Lilith."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "...Ah!
- That man in white..."
- Michael:
- "That was Gabriel,
- messenger of the gods.
- Why do you think
- I went out of my way to send him?
- Your prominent activities
- draw the attention of even us archangels.
- Accordingly, you must not allow yourself to fall
- to the machinations of demons.
- Stray not
- from the righteous path, 
- and be granted the providence of Heaven.
- (Protagonist Name):
- "You mean...
- you're saying you'll help me get out of this building...
- ...?"
- Michael:
- "Angels spare no succor
- to those who follow the will of God.
- (Protagonist Name).
- Know that Lilith is a trap."
- ?:
- "Insolent words, coming from an angel!"
- Michael:
- "!"
- 
- Darkness arrived.
- It swelled and expanded, 
- eroding the light emanating from the archangel.
- And from the darkness
- walked a man dressed in black...
- 
- Michael:
- "Satan."
- Satan:
- "It's been a while, hasn't it, Michael?"
- Michael:
- "Leave this place.
- I have no words to speak to you."
- Satan:
- "I'm afraid I can't let it be.
- Not after hearing you call her a demon's trap.
- An evil plot, even?"
- Michael:
- "That's correct.
- Demons exist to mislead, 
- deceive, and corrupt humans."
- Satan:
- "Not quite, archangel.
- To be misled,
- to be deceived, and to be corrupted are what it means to be human.
- Demons simply enable it.
- Unlike angels, who refuse to accept
- humanity's weakness.
- Lilith is the same.
- ... (Protagonist Name).
- Unable to leave you to die, her heart, in that moment of death, 
- bore a certain doubt.
- I simply accepted it
- as it was."
- Michael:
- "Mere sophistry!"
- Satan:
- "My words, or yours, I wonder."
- 
- It was a confrontation of light and darkness.
- Funnily enough, 
- the two seemed similar in some way,
- even though they were polar opposites...
- 
- Michael:
- "God is Truth.
- So it was decided
- in the beginning, and necessitates
- no validation."
- Satan:
- "Is that so?
- Funny.
- Then, allow me to see it through to the end."
- 
- Satan sent a glance towards my direction, 
- then smiled.
- I could see indignation flaring in Michael's face.
- However...
- As the angel retracted his wings, 
- his figure seemed to fade into the light.
- 
- Michael:
- "Do not forget my words."
- 
- The demon similiarly began to 
- step into the darkness. 
- 
- Satan:
- "There's nothing emptier than an angel's words..."
- 
- Then, the two left. What remained
- was just one
- lone human.
- 
- -13F-
- 
- Lilith:
- "(Protagonist Name)..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "L-..."
- 
- Lilith,
- I tried to called out, but stopped.
- Was she (Heroine Name), 
- at this point?
- Then again, 
- she was undoubtedly a demon.
- As if to jolt those thoughts out of me,
- Lilith began to sway and change form
- before my very eyes.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "!!"
- 
- What lay there was none other than
- dear (Heroine Name).
- Reunited with someone
- I thought I'd never meet again, 
- I felt a heat well up inside me.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "(Heroine Name)!"
- Lilith:
- "(Protagonist Name)...
- I'm sorry...
- I'm hurting you, aren't I?
- But...
- even so, I wanted to be with you.
- No matter what, I couldn't bear
- to lose you like that.
- Maybe it was all my ego.
- But...
- There was no other way.
- Nothing other than to accept Lord Satan's pact,
- and serve him as the demon Lilith.
- (Protagonist Name):
- "What is Satan trying to have you do
- ?"
- 
- Lilith shook her head.
- I wondered if she couldn't say it.
- Satan was her master, after all.
- 
- Lilith:
- "But, I can say this.
- I live for your sake.
- That is my life's purpose.
- And...
- my feelings never changed..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "(Heroine Name)...!"
- 
- [Choose]
- �Maybe God has the power to do something.
- �I don't care even if you're a demon!
- �But, you're under Satan's control...
- 
- When 'Maybe God has the power to do something.' is chosen:
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Maybe God has the power to do something.
- Michael said it, didn't he?
- 'Angels spare no succor
- to those who follow the will of God.' 
- Even though you're a demon right now, you were a human originally.
- Plus...
- You haven't lost your heart.
- It seems more like you're being tricked by Satan.
- ... The angels will definitely understand."
- Lilith:
- "(Protagonist Name)..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "At any rate, I aim to break through to the next floor.
- ... I'll defeat demons, 
- acting in accordance with the will of God.
- If I do so, I may be able to save you...
- ..."
- 
- Lilith smiled
- and nodded, but 
- that smile seemed somewhat lonely.
- 
- Lilith:
- "I should get going.
- I'm still a demon, after all.
- Those angels won't be too happy
- if we stay together too long, will they?"
- 
- And so she left.
- 
- When 'I don't care even if you're a demon!' is chosen:
- (Protagonist Name):
- "I don't care even if you're a demon!
- No matter what,
- you'll always be (Heroine Name)!
- You haven't lost your compassion...
- Isn't that enough?"
- 
- Lilith showed a downcast expression.
- 
- Lilith:
- "At some point, 
- you'll have to make a choice..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "A choice?
- What kind?"
- Lilith:
- "One that will determine your fate.
- I exist to guide that choice, 
- and, in turn, be guided by it."
- 
- Her words puzzled me.
- 
- Lilith:
- "It's still not that time yet...
- But please don't forget.
- That time will come..."
- 
- Leaving only those words,
- Lilith departed.
- 
- When 'But, you're under Satan's control...' is chosen:
- (Protagonist Name):
- "But, you're under Satan's control...
- you were probably ordered
- to get close to me, right?"
- Lilith:
- "That's..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "There's no way a demon would make a deal
- without getting anything in return.
- Just what is his objective?"
- Lilith:
- "......"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "In the first place,
- can you even really prove that you're (Heroine Name)?"
- Lilith:
- "!"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "That in itself may be
- another one of their traps, huh."
- Lilith:
- "Yeah,
- you might be right..."
- 
- Though Lilith showed a sorrowful expression at first, 
- before long, a seductive smile hung upon her lips.
- 
- Lilith:
- "Lord Satan
- may just like that
- about you..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "What do you mean?"
- Lilith:
- "You'll understand eventually.
- ...... Let's meet again.
- Hehe."
- 
- Leaving only those words,
- Lilith departed.
- 
- -12F-
- 
- Gently,
- something fluttered down in front of me.
- It was a playing card.
- Flipping it over, I saw the queen of spades.
- 
- Lucifer:
- "Hey, looks like we meet again."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Lucifer... right?"
- Lucifer:
- "You remembered me?
- What an honor.
- Incidentally, you've likely met Lilith again, yes?
- What did she say?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "She said she lived for my sake..."
- Lucifer:
- "I see.
- ... Then, what about you?
- She was your girlfriend, wasn't she?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "I..."
- 
- [Choose]
- �I'll save her.
- �I want to know her true feelings.
- �I'm worried she may be an enemy.
- 
- When 'I'll save her' is chosen:
- (Protagonist Name):
- "I'll save her."
- Lucifer:
- "Save her?
- How?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "I'm still figuring that out..."
- Lucifer:
- "Hoh.
- Well, it's fine...
- But..."
- 
- A suggestive look emerged on Lucifer's face.
- 
- Lucifer:
- "Is that really what she wants?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Huh?"
- Lucifer:
- "She exists for your sake.
- She said that, didn't she?
- Yet you speak of saving her.
- You should think on the meaning of her words."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "... What do you mean?"
- Lucifer:
- "Who knows.
- That's something for you to figure out!
- ... Let's meet again, 
- if the opportunity ever arises."
- 
- Lucifer soon disappeared,
- laughter filling his wake.
- 
- When 'I want to know her true feelings' is chosen:
- (Protagonist Name):
- "I want to know her true feelings."
- Lucifer:
- "True feelings?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Yeah...
- She may be a demon, but...
- she still seems human at heart...
- Honestly, just what is she thinking...
- I don't understand her how she feels.
- If I did, I could at least do 
- what she wants me to..."
- Lucifer:
- "Hoh.
- Well, it's fine...
- But..."
- 
- A suggestive look emerged on Lucifer's face.
- 
- Lucifer:
- "Is that really what she wants?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Huh?"
- Lucifer:
- "She exists for your sake.
- She said that, didn't she?
- And yet you say
- that her feelings are important.
- You should think on the meaning of her words."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "... What do you mean?"
- Lucifer:
- "Who knows.
- That's something for you to figure out!
- ... Let's meet again, 
- if the opportunity ever arises."
- 
- Lucifer soon disappeared,
- laughter filling his wake.
- 
- If 'I'm worried she may be an enemy' is chosen:
- (Protagonist Name):
- "I'm worried she may be an enemy."
- Lucifer:
- "Is that so?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "No matter how many times you say she's reborn, 
- she's a demon, plus
- she's contracted with Satan.
- She...
- She shouldn't be able to oppose Satan's command.
- Maybe it's some kind of scheme..."
- Lucifer:
- "Hoh.
- Well, it's fine..."
- 
- A suggestive look emerged on Lucifer's face.
- 
- Lucifer:
- "She exists for your sake.
- She said that, didn't she?
- You should think on the meaning of her words."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Huh?"
- "... What do you mean?"
- Lucifer:
- "Who knows.
- That's something for you to figure out!
- ... Let's meet again, 
- if the opportunity ever arises."
- 
- Lucifer soon disappeared,
- laughter filling his wake.
- 
- -11F-
- 
- The room was dark and smelled of mold,
- with spider's nests littered about, 
- giving the impression it had
- been abandoned for untold years.
- Candlesticks neatly lined the walls, 
- and what seemed to be an old stone coffin
- was placed towards the center.
- It seemed like there would be a stairway up ahead.
- Thinking so, I stepped into the room, 
- and suddenly, countless candles lit up.
- With a menacing rumble, 
- the stone coffin slowly started to open.
- Once again, it looked like I wasn't getting through for free.
- Appearing from the coffin together with pallid light was
- a fanged, red-eyed man wearing a cloak.
- He looked like a vampire straight out of a movie!
- 
- Vampire:
- "I am Vampire,
- divorced from the mortal coil, 
- the undying king of darkness.
- Will you join me and live in the darkness forever more?
- Or will you give up every last drop of your life...?
- Make your decision."
- 
- "Woah, are you serious?!
- You think I'll let myself get turned into a zombie in a place like this?!"
- 
- Three Yoma Vampire appeared.
- 
- "Gyaaaaa!!"
- The vampires raised their final cries.
- Their bodies crumbled away like sand, 
- and before long, only dirt remained in the coffin.
- Seeing that I had safely gotten through the encounter,
- I took a breath in relief.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "... Oh? This is......"
- 
- Peeking into the now-ownerless coffin, 
- I spotted a sword.
- It must've been the one of the vampire's private property.
- The blade's body was simple, but
- the tip, which let out a calm brilliance, 
- seemed stacked with both sharpness and pliancy.
- I couldn't read the inscription, but
- it was surely the work of some famous smith.
- (You obtained the Spirit Sword)
- Graciously accepting this gift, 
- I departed, sword in hand.
