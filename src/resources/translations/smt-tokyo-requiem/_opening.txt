# Opening
- Everything was
- plastered with darkness.
- It seemed my will alone drifted through
- that directionless abyss.
- As if dozing off,
- keeping the course,
- making indecision seem
- a pleasant thought.
- Yet,
- from across the darkness
- came someone's voice.
- 
- Voice:
- "Return.
- This isn't somewhere you
- should come to just yet.
- Are you lost?
- In that case, I'll show you the way.
- Now...
- Your name is...?"
- Name Registration: YOUR NAME
- (Input Protagonist Name)
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "I....
- I'm,
- (Protagonist Name)."
- 
- Voice:
- "Then, (Protagonist Name),
- you must return to the world
- where you belong.
- For that, first...
- you must clearly reenvision
- your existence itself.
- Just what sort of a being where you...?
- Come, try to look back and see."
- 
- (Distribute 10 parameter points)
- "It seems you've gotten ahold of yourself.
- Then, go.
- Towards your journey..."
