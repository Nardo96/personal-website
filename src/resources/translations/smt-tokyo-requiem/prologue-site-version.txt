- Tokyo Requiem Prologue
- 
- December 24, 201X
- The christmas present Tokyo got that day was death and destruction.
- 
- "Whatever..."
- A young man, together with his girlfriend, was at a trendy 35 floor building - in Tokyo.
- Though they were on a date, only the woman was enjoying it, with him feeling - somehow unsatisfied.
- In the gloomy midst of wondering why that was, an email arrived at his - cellphone.
- The sender had no name, and written in the message was just one thing:
- 
- "Will you decide?"
- 
- Attached to the email was a shady file.
- "What... is this --"
- He opened the file.
- 
- D. I. O. system, compile, link...
- 
- Abruptly, the woman returned, having bought a drink.
- It was then --
- 
- Flash!
- 
- Several minutes earlier.
- Atop a screen surveilling the Tokyo airspace, countless dots of light suddenly - lit up.
- "Why didn't they show up till now?!"
- The bellows blended together. The self defence force was in shambles.
- 
- December 24, 201X --
- The flames of nuclear war burned Tokyo to the ground. In an instant, the - capital was brought to a halt, countless lives mercilessly taken.
- With the crumbling of infrastructure came a giant electromagnetic pulse, - destroying the electrical grid, and wiping out what remained of Tokyo's - information systems.
- The young pair was no exception. In those final moments, as those - out-stretched hands were on the verge of touching, everything was swallowed up - by light.
- 
- As if to loudly herald the end of Man.
- Surrounded by debris, those who narrowly survived watch on to see the shadows - of countless monsters within the flame- s.
