# Chapter 6
- -B3F-
- 
- Bartender:
- "This'll be the final camp.
- If you can get to the first floor from here,
- it looks like you'll be able to escape the building...
- The enemies from here on out aren't small fry, 
- so make sure to properly prepare your equipment.
- There's armor with built-in resistances too -
- the trick is to choose armor to deal with
- a wide variety of attacks."
- 
- -1F-
- 
- LAW Route
- 
- A dazzling light
- lit up my surroundings as bright as midday.
- Archangel Michael,
- cloaked in a godly aura,
- stood there.
- 
- Michael:
- "You have done well to come thus far.
- Even the heavens look over your deeds.
- Such being the case, about Lilith...
- How is this?
- If you continue to fight for our sake, 
- to take the path of light made manifest by His grace, then...
- By the power of God, I shall bestow salvation upon Lilith."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "...R-Really?!"
- Michael:
- "Truly.
- God will never abandon
- those lambs who stride the righteous path.
- He will purge those foolish enough to be drawn to darkness,
- bring salvation to this dying world, and restore the proper order.
- Come, vow to fight together with us."
- 
- [Choose]
- ・I will fight for God.
- ・A human has no right to judge other humans.
- 
- If 'I will fight for God.' is chosen:
- (Protagonist Name):
- "... Yes.
- I will fight for God."
- 
- Hearing that response, 
- Michael nodded, satisfied.
- 
- Michael:
- "Then, go forth.
- The providence of heaven is always looking over you!"
- 
- Feeling the radiance of heaven on my back,
- I stepped forth, a warrior of light...
- (Final aligment is locked to LAW)
- 
- If 'A human has no right to judge other humans.' is chosen:
- (Protagonist Name):
- "But...
- A human has no right to judge other humans.
- I don't mean to be an ally to demons, but...
- As to whether it's the right thing
- to lead humans to be judged by the will of God...
- I still don't know."
- 
- Hearing that response, 
- A disappointed expression appeared on Michael's face.
- 
- Michael:
- "Such folly...
- For a human born of God to follow His will
- and preserve order is undoubtedly the righteous path.
- But, 
- To herd those lost, wandering lambs of God,
- is a task that falls upon us angels.
- It is not yet too late.
- Until you correct your thoughts and begin to repent,
- I shall briefly remain here."
- 
- Having said so, 
- he disappeared into the light.
- 
- -1F Gate-
- 
- The hall I was in had a tall ceiling, 
- and the gate visible in front was...
- the entrance!
- An exit to get out of this building!
- I had finally come that far -
- I felt a heat well up inside me.
- .... Then.
- A single silhouette stood at the front.
- That supple, graceful body.
- That glossy, long hair.
- Those beautiful, sagacious eyes.
- And those seductive - licentious, even - lips...
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "... Lilith..."
- Lilith:
- "We've finally come this far, haven't we..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Lilith - no, (Heroine Name)...
- I came to get you.
- Let's leave together."
- Lilith:
- "I can't.
- I'm a demon...
- I can't be together with you..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "If we rely on the Archangels' help...
- The power of God will definitely save you!
- ... It's going to be okay, believe me."
- 
- Lilith shook her head.
- 
- Lilith:
- "No.
- That won't happen.
- I am a demon.
- The salvation God would grant a demon,
- is oblivion only."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "... Huh...?"
- Lilith:
- "You see... I made a pact with Satan.
- A pact to draw you to the demons' side.
- But your heart was drawn to light instead.
- Leaving me all alone!!
- Please! Please, don't go...
- Stay here, together with me..."
- 
- Lilith's body started to creak and groan
- as it swelled and changed shape...
- In the end,
- what appeared 
- could not have been called Lilith.
- 
- ?:
- "Let us drift eternally
- within the unfathomable depths of darkness.
- I won't let go again..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "(Heroine Name)... you..."
- ?:
- "That's... why...
- I'll... eat it all up...
- ... all of your soul!!"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "What's wrong?!
- (Heroine Name)!
- No.... No way...!!"
- 
- One Femme (Heroine Name) appeared.
- 
- -Ending-
- 
- Why
- must I suffer to this point, 
- cycling again and again
- through such scenes of despair?
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Lilith-
- No...
- (Heroine Name)...
- (Heroine Name)...!"
- (Heroine Name):
- "Ugh....
- (Protagonist Name)..."
- 
- It was almost as if the one
- who lay dying in my arms
- wasn't the demon Lilith,
- but rather that dear young woman
- who I left forever parted
- the day of Tokyo's nuclear conflagration.
- 
- (Heroine Name):
- "No-
- I'm scared...
- No... no...
- I don't want to die...!"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "(Heroine Name)...
- At least...
- At least... within my arms..."
- 
- That moment,
- a dazzling light 
- enveloped their bodies.
- As if washing away 
- the miasma of darkness that covered her,
- the light gently
- shined upon her cheek.
- 
- (Heroine Name):
- "Wha- 
- ... I'm..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "... Your sins..."
- (Heroine Name):
- "(Protagonist Name)...
- I..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "... are being purified..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "(Heroine Name),
- you're -
- you're free..."
- 
- That warm, dazzling white light
- slowly grew bit by bit,
- until eventually even opening my eyes
- had become a difficult task.
- The instant that shine 
- dazzled even brighter,
- I closed my eyes.
- 
- (Heroine Name):
- "(Protagonist Name)...
- Good... bye..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Rest peacefully...
- (Heroine Name)..."
- 
- The vortex of light abated,
- and as my surroundings once again
- filled with tranquility and stillness, 
- the young woman lying in my arms
- disappeared without a trace.
- MORS CERTA
- ET HORA INCERTA
- Death is certain,
- and its call,
-  uncertain,
- or so it's said in Latin.
- Each and every living being
- will eventually return to the side of the Lord.
- There exists none who violate this order,
- nor is the day of rapture
- knowable to human minds.
- Born a human,
- and reborn a demon...
- And once more,
- as a human,
- she returned to God.
- Such a tumultous fate
- was also set by
- the exalted grace of God.
- When I thought of that noble soul,
- cleansed of filth and impurity,
- I was gripped with the need to pray.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "That her soul
- strays not from the righteous path.
- That she is bestowed the providence of God.
- And.
- That she finds peace for all eternity -
- I pray."
- 
- <END>
- 
- NEUTRAL Route
- 
- Lucifer:
- "Hello there, I hope you've been well."
- 
- Lucifer stood there,
- grinning all the while.
- 
- Lucifer:
- "You've done well to get this far.
- Not bad, not bad."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Yeah, somehow."
- Lucifer:
- "... So.
- Have you come to a decision?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Huh?"
- Lucifer:
- "You know, about Lilith.
- You've finally come this far...
- Only you can save her at this point.
- Your choice 
- will determine the culmination of your fates.
- Are you prepared for that?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "That..."
- 
- [Choose]
- ・I understand. I'll judge for myself.
- ・Maybe there's some other way...
- 
- If 'I understand. I'll judge for myself."　is chosen:
- (Protagonist Name):
- "I understand.
- I'll judge for myself."
- 
- Hearing that response, 
- Lucifer let out a laugh like the Cheshire Cat.
- 
- Lucifer:
- "Will you side with God, side with demons,
- or cut through it all with your own strength?
- The answer lies within you."
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "The fate of Lilith and I...
- I'll decide it for myself."
- Lucifer:
- "Then, go on.
- She's waiting for you."
- 
- Lucifer sent me off as I,
- with my own strength, stepped forward...
- (Final alignment will be set
- to current alignment. To select the NEUTRAL route, 
- Set the protagonist's alignment to NEUTRAL beforehand.)
- 
- If 'Maybe there's some other way...'　is chosen:
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Maybe there's some other way...
- Plus... is fate really something
- that humans can set and change 
- at will?"
- 
- Hearing that response, 
- Lucifer let out a laugh like the Cheshire Cat.
- 
- Lucifer:
- "It looks like you're still hesitating, yes?
- "Then, until you arrive at your conclusion, 
- I'll be waiting here."
- 
- Having said so, 
- he disappeared.
- 
- -1F Gate-

-

- Lilith:
- "We've finally come this far, haven't we..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Lilith - no, (Heroine Name)...
- I came to get you.
- Let's leave together."
- Lilith:
- "I can't.
- You see... I made a pact with Satan.
- I can't go together with you."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "I don't care even if you're a demon!
- What really matters is your heart.
- Whether Satan or whoever, I'll beat them all for you!"
- Lilith:
- "(Protagonist Name)..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "... It's going to be okay, believe me."
- 
- Yet,
- Lilith showed a sorrowful expression.
- 
- Lilith:
- "Do you really understand what it means
- to destroy Satan?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "(Heroine Name)...?"
- Lilith:
- "Even if you do manage to defeat Satan, 
- I am bound as a contractor,
- and will meet the same fate...
- Moreover, I took a vow.
- A vow to draw you to the demons' side.
- If I can't, only destruction awaits me...
- But there is one way..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "What is it?
- Tell me, (Heroine Name)!"
- 
- But then Lilith, on the verge of speaking, 
- was swathed in an ominous light, 
- her figure undergoing a terrifying change.
- 
- ?:
- "Your soul... if I were to consume it...
- If I did, we could live together as the same demon!"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Hey- (Heroine Name)!
- Wait! Please, wait!!"
- 
- One Femme (Heroine Name) appeared.
- 
- -Ending-
- 
- Why
- must I suffer to this point, 
- cycling again and again
- through such scenes of despair?
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Lilith-
- No...
- (Heroine Name)...
- (Heroine Name)...!"
- (Heroine Name):
- "Ugh....
- (Protagonist Name)..."
- 
- It was almost as if the one
- who lay dying in my arms
- wasn't the demon Lilith,
- but rather that dear young woman
- who I left forever parted
- the day of Tokyo's nuclear conflagration.
- 
- (Heroine Name):
- "(Protagonist Name)...
- I could at least 
- die within your arms...
- I..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "No-
- Don't die, (Heroine Name)!
- Not you...!"
- 
- That moment,
- a dazzling light 
- enveloped her body.
- 
- (Heroine Name):
- "I'm glad...
- Finally, in the end...
- I could return...
- to being a human..."
- 
- That warm, dazzling white light
- slowly grew bit by bit,
- until eventually even opening my eyes
- had become a difficult task.
- The instant that shine 
- dazzled even brighter,
- I closed my eyes.
- 
- (Heroine Name):
- "(Protagonist Name)...
- Thank... you..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "(Heroine Name)!!"
- 
- The vortex of light abated,
- and as my surroundings 
- once again filled
- with tranquility and stillness, 
- the young woman lying in my arms
- disappeared without a trace.
- Defeated by our battle,
- Lilith return to her former self -
- she returned to being (Heroine Name).
- She was smiling.
- And while smiling at me,
- she told me, "Thank you."
- I don't know if a human who's
- exchanged oaths with a demon
- can return to being human.
- But.
- In that moment of death,
- at heart, she was undoubtedly...
- no longer Lilith.
- She was exactly how (Heroine Name) used to be.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "It's...
- It's better this way, right...?"
- 
- I questioned no one in particular,
- nor was there any response.
- Each and every living being
- will eventually return to dust.
- There exists none who violate this order,
- while those who are left,
- cannot bring themselves to forsake living.
- Yet, precisely because of that,
- I will not regret.
- Not that I continue to live,
- nor that I lost her.
- I will not regret.
- The path she chose,
- as well as the path
- I myself grasped, 
- were both the best choices we could make.
- If I don't believe that,
- I won't be able to continue any further.
- In the end, humans
- are that sort of creature.
- 
- <END>
- 
- CHAOS Route
- 
- A freezing darkness surged forth, 
- enveloping my surroundings.
- Satan, 
- cloaked in a jet black mantle,
- stood there.
- 
- Satan:
- "You have done well to come this far.
- A good show, indeed.
- Accordingly, I bring a proposition.
- How about it?
- Won't you try joining hands with demons,
- and use your strength for our sake?
- If you do so...
- I shall grant you that woman."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "...L-Lilith?!"
- Satan:
- "That's right.
- You may treat her as you please.
- You'll be able to return to how it was before.
- As one aligned with demons,
- that is."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "......"
- Satan:
- "What will you choose, I wonder?"
- 
- [Choose]
- ・I understand. I'll side with demons.
- ・I want to stay a human.
- 
- If 'I understand. I'll side with demons.' is chosen:
- (Protagonist Name):
- "I understand.
- I'll side with demons."
- 
- Hearing that response, 
- Satan nodded with satisfaction.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "With this, Lilith with really be free, right?"
- Satan:
- "Demons will not err from a contract.
- ...Then, go forth.
- Us demons will spare no effort in assisting you."
- 
- Feeling the chill of darkness on my back,
- I stepped forth, a demon warrior...
- (Final alignment set to CHAOS)
- 
- If 'I want to stay a human.' is chosen:
- (Protagonist Name):
- "I want to stay a human...
- I want to let Lilith free, but...
- If that means throwing away my humanity...
- Moreover, I can't trust that
- you'll really uphold your end of the bargain."
- 
- Hearing that response, 
- an eerie smile floated up Satan's face.
- 
- Satan:
- "A pair of star-crossed lovers, finally about to become one, 
- and yet you fuss about staying human...
- I cannot understand it, but very well.
- There is no need for concern.
- A demon's oath is absolute.
- Even I am no exception to that rule.
- Seeing as you are unable to come to a decision, 
- I shall briefly remain here."
- 
- Having said so, 
- he disappeared into the dark.
- 
- -1F Gate-
- 
- The hall I was in had a tall ceiling, 
- and the gate visible in front was...
- the entrance!
- An exit to get out of this building!
- I had finally come that far -
- I felt a heat well up inside me.
- .... Then.
- A single silhouette stood at the front.
- That supple, graceful body.
- That glossy, long hair.
- Those beautiful, sagacious eyes.
- And those seductive - licentious, even - lips...
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "... Lilith..."
- Lilith:
- "We've finally come this far, haven't we..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Lilith - no, (Heroine Name)...
- I'll also contract with Satan.
- I won't let you go alone."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "From now on, we'll always be together..."
- Lilith:
- "Really...?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Really.
- I won't back out anymore."
- 
- A look of hesitation appeared on Lilith's face.
- Then,
- she started looking at me with sorrowful eyes.
- 
- Lilith:
- "I can't go.
- In the end...
- I can't go together with you."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "W-what?!
- Why?!"
- Lilith:
- "It's certainly true that with this, 
- in accordance with my oath to Lord Satan, 
- I managed to draw you into the darkness...
- Moreover, just as Lord Satan vowed to me, 
- we can be joined together for eternity.
- But..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "What do you mean, 'But...'?!
- (Heroine Name)!
- We can finally be together!"
- Lilith:
- "Yeah.
- That's how it should have been.
- But... but..."
- 
- Shockingly clear tears
- trickled down Lilith's face.
- 
- Lilith:
- "... I just got it now.
- That this was a mistake...
- I changed you...
- You're no longer
- the (Protagonist Name) I know."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "No way!
- This is the me you wanted me to be!
- No matter how much I change, I'll always be myself!"
- Lilith:
- "No!
- I should have been the only one to fall...
- All of this is my fault..."
- 
- As soon as she said so, lightning rushed down from the firmament,
- enveloping Lilith's body with a holy aura,
- and eliciting a transformation into the form of empyrean light.
- 
- ?:
- "So, at least...
- I'll save you...
- I'll save your soul!!"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Don't screw with me, (Heroine Name)! 
- I depraved myself for you...
- and you're... gonna betray me?!!"
- 
- One Femme (Heroine Name) appeared.
- 
- -Ending-
- 
- When I made up my mind, 
- I didn't have a shred of hesitation.
- Lilith's eyes, wet from tears of love, 
- opened up widely...
- and warped.
- That fallen young woman, 
- at death's door from severe injuries, 
- tried to stand up
- all the same.
- But, those injuries must have be hurting.
- While pressing down on her side, 
- she curled her body small
- on top of the floor.
- 
- Lilith:
- "Ugh-... Nn-..."
- 
- I couldn't let my guard down just yet.
- The woman anguishing in front of me
- was Fallen Lilith, one who
- contracted with Satan, was reborn, 
- and obtained power unknown to man.
- Until the black light of life was extinguished,
- I couldn't relax.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Does it hurt... Lilith?"
- Lilith:
- "...Ugh-....
- "(Protagonist Name)...
- you can't...
- go...
- you're..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Uh huh...
- so it hurts..."
- Lilith:
- "Aaah-!"
- 
- I saw Lilith's stomach rise and fall
- from her weak breaths,
- and dispassionately, I stepped on it.
- A line of blood 
- roughly overflowed
- from the corner of her mouth.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "At the very least, I'll give you a parting gift.
- I will end
- your suffering."
- Lilith:
- "Stop...
- Any more than this, and you'll..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Sleep. Forever."
- 
- "... Your sins...
- ... please... no more..."
- That hoarse, tragic voice held no power, 
- and with an ominous, final quiver, 
- her pulse disappeared.
- Not a single person remained
- to see that final, clear tear
- stream down the face
- of that departed woman.
- Good exists on one side of the coin,
- and on the other,
- evil.
- But, 
- There are not many who can clearly demarcate
- the line between these two extremes.
- Depending on the times, the subject,
- and the circumstances surrounding them, 
- the same thing
- could be judged as both good or evil.
- But, 
- whichever age,
- whichever subject,
- in all things, there exists 
- only one absolute.
- Overwhelming power.
- Alongside
- the bottomless desire
- that will serve
- as the source of that power.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "That's right...
- What rules over this world
- is strength and desire.
- Craving
- controls the hearts of man,
- who in turn
- seek power.
- And only those who obtain that power
- gain the right to grant their own desires.
- One who's obtained it all -
- that
- is me."
