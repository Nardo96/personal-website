- Bartender:
- "Word on the street is,
- the stairwell leading down 
- from the 2nd to the 1st floor's been sealed.
- You'll have to go directly to the basement from the 2nd floor.
- It sounds like
- demons' physical attack and defence are influenced by LV, 
- so it'll likely be easier to advance
- after you've properly raised your LV."
- 
- -4F-
- 
- It was a wide room,
- with many chairs lined up to 
- face a markedly raised spot.
- It looked like a terrificly simple stage.
- Could there have been some sort of seminar here?
- That moment, suddenly, 
- I heard a singing voice come out of nowhere.
- The bright, resounding voice of a man
- sung a gloomy melody.
- Just what...?
- 
- [Choose]
- ・Who is that?　I'll look for the vocalist.
- ・I'll listen in for a bit...
- ・A demon's trap?　I'll interrupt the song.
- 
- If 'Who is that?　I'll look for the vocalist.' is chosen:
- Who in the world could have been singing
- in a place like that?
- I looked for the owner of that voice, but
- from the beginning, no one had been in the room.
- There didn't seem to be neither any hidden speaker
- nor any place to hide in.
- As I did this and that, 
- I didn't even notice the song stop.
- What was left was only silence...
- Could it have been a demon's mischief?
- I decided to leave the room behind me.
- 
- If 'I'll listen in for a bit...' is chosen:
- I sat down in one of the seats.
- The song was filled with a passion
- for someone who wasn't there.
- As I listened,
- I felt it pierce and permeate my chest -
- like my chest was getting tighter.
- Nonetheless, it was a magnificant voice.
- One could probably call the vocalist considerably skilled.
- When the song eventually stopped,
- without thinking,
- I stood up and applaused.
- And then...
- From here and there across that ostensibly empty room,
- I heard the sound of clapping.
- Before I knew it, I was in the middle of an ovation.
- From somewhere...
- I felt the unseen vocalist
- respond in kind, giving a bow...
- It was that sort of a mysterious sensation.
- Then, the room was once again cloaked in stillness.
- No matter how much I waited after that, 
- I couldn't hear the song.
- Though the puzzle remained, 
- filled with a sense of satisfaction over hearing a good song, 
- I decided to leave the room behind me.
- 
- If 'A demon's trap?'　I'll interrupt the song.' is chosen:
- There shouldn't have been any human
- singing in a place like that.
- It had to be a demon's trap, 
- so I needed to not listen to the song.
- I tried to block my ears, but
- the singing voice subsequently grew louder.
- So, I punted off the chair next to me.
- One by one, I kicked over the chairs,
- raising up a racket to hamper the song.
- It seemed it didn't like that, 
- as the voice suddenly snapped and died off.
- No matter how much I waited after that, 
- I couldn't hear the song.
- I looked for the owner of that voice, but
- from the beginning, no one had been in the room.
- There didn't seem to be neither any hidden speaker
- nor any place to hide in.
- Could it have been a demon's mischief?
- I decided to leave the room behind me.
- 
- -2F-
- 
- A sweet scent softly tickled my sense of smell.
- Somehow, the middle of the room had the form of a garden,
- with one face teeming with blooming roses.
- Further,
- they were all black.
- 
- Lilith:
- "...Oh?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Woah, Lilith!?"
- 
- She was there in a bed of roses.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Just where is this...?
- What are you doing?"
- Lilith:
- "This is the demons' rose garden.
- I'm...
- I'm picking roses for Lord Satan."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "You're what...?"
- 
- [Choose]
- ・Then, I'll help you.
- ・Satan likes flowers...?
- ・That guy has no need for anything like a flower!
- 
- If 'Then, I'll help you.' is chosen:
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Then, I'll help you."
- Lilith:
- "Really?　Then, please and thank you."
- 
- Together with Lilith, we circled the rose garden
- picking roses.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "...ouch!"
- Lilith:
- "Ah-... are you ok?"
- 
- I had carelessly pricked my finger
- with a rose's thorn.
- Then, Lilith brought my finger to her mouth...
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Ah..."
- 
- I felt Lilith's lips touch my bloodstained finger,
- spreading a warmth upon the tip...
- Even a demon could hold this kind of warmth?
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Um, thanks..."
- 
- Lilith smiled and laughed.
- Somehow, I felt my cheeks heat up.
- That manner
- was exactly how (Heroine Name) used to be.
- Yet, she was a demon now...
- I felt myself grow sad and irritated.
- 
- Lilith:
- "Thanks.
- It should be fine now.
- ... Then, I'll be going."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Yeah."
- 
- Lilith held her flowers
- as I saw her off.
- Though I stood there for a while,
- I couldn't keep standing there forever,
- and so I left the rose garden.
- 
- If 'Satan likes flowers...?'　is chosen:
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Satan likes flowers...?"
- Lilith:
- "Yup.
- Lord Satan likes, among other things,
- the black roses of this garden."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Hmm..."
- 
- Nonchalantly,
- I continued to watch over Lilith pick roses.
- The figure of that hand happily stretching towards flowers
- brought back memories of what used to be (Heroine Name).
- Yet, she was a demon now...
- I felt myself grow kind of sad, 
- and kind of irritated
- Moreover, that picking flowers
- was for Satan's sake was...
- Was she ordered and doing it unwillingly?
- Or.
- As a demon, was she fostering
- an adoration for Satan?
- 
- Lilith:
- "It should be fine now.
- ... then, I'll be going..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Yeah."
- 
- Lilith held her flowers as I saw her off.
- Though I stood there for a while,
- I couldn't keep standing there forever,
- and so I left the rose garden.
- 
- If 'That guy has no need for anything like a flower!'　is chosen:
- (Protagonist Name):
- "That guy has no need for anything like a flower!"
- Lilith:
- "But..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "A rose garden like this- !"
- 
- I stomped over the nearby bed,
- eliciting a cry from Lilith.
- 
- Lilith:
- "How could you do that?!
- Lord Satan's roses... !"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Why do you listen to anything he has to say?
- Because of you're under oath?
- Or...
- Because you care that much about him..."
- Lilith:
- "What are you talking about?
- At any rate,
- I have to go deliver these roses.
- If you're gonna be a hindrance, then please leave.
- This is the demons' rose garden.
- It's a forbidden place, 
- not one a human should be coming into in the first place."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Oh, is that so?
- Understood."
- 
- I felt myself grow kind of sad, 
- and kind of irritated.
- One last time, I sent a kick packed with my resentment
- flying towards the rose next to me,
- then left the garden.
- 
- -B4F-
- 
- CRACK!!
- That instant, a single strand of thunder struck.
- A glaring light appeared together with a large shadow
- as a looming, gargantuan figure
- stared closely at me.
- Its burly frame housed countless hands,
- its overwhelming glare making any observer cower.
- That ferocious, yet graceful and divine appearance
- reminded me of a certain mythical god of destruction.
- 
- Diety:
- "I am Shiva.
- Human, heed my words.
- Thou hast done well to come this far.
- That power...
- It is regrettable to leave that much in a human's hand.
- Though it is a shame, 
- thy fate ends here.
- By godly lightning be burned!
- Meet thine end!"
- 
- I heard a voice as deafening as thunder.
- From heaven came a rumbling will, 
- rippling through the trembling atmosphere.
- This was no joke!
- Did he think I would just sit there and die?!
- 
- Two Fury Shiva appeared.
- 
- Shiva:
- "M-Magnificent!"
- 
- Bereft of strength and kneeling one leg, the god of destruction
- nonetheless began speaking with greater steadiness.
- 
- Shiva:
- "To think... a human's power could reach this far...
- It seems I have looked down on thee...
- I recognize thy strength of will, and grant thee power.
- What dost thou desire?"
- 
- [Choose]
- ・I want Strength.
- ・I want Magic.
- ・I want Agility.
- 
- If 'I want strength' is chosen:
- Shiva:
- "Then, take this."
- 
- You obtained an Incense of Strength!
- You obtained an Incense of Vitality!
- 
- If 'I want Magic' is chosen:
- Shiva:
- "Then, take this."
- 
- You obtained an Incense of Wisdom!
- You obtained an Incense of Magic!
- 
- If 'I want Agility' is chosen:
- Shiva:
- "Then, take this."
- 
- You obtained an Incense of Agility!
- You obtained an Incense of Strength!
- 
- Shiva:
- "Beyond this, 
- a harsh, grave decision 
- awaits thee...
- However, as long as thou hast the strength of will lying in thine eyes, 
- thou shalt surely overcome this adversity.
- If we are
- to meet once more, 
- I shall lend thee my power.
- Walk the path thou believest in."
- 
- After speaking so, the god of destruction crumbled away.
- Before long,
- that body had turned to powder, disappearing into the wind.
- The end time was near -
- I felt that.
- Just a bit more.
- Wait for me, (Heroine Name)...
- I strengthed the grip on my fist.
