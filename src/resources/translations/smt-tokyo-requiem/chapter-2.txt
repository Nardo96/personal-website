# Chapter 2
- -20F-
- 
- Bartender:
- "For the lower floors, 
- I hear that demonic attacks have gotten more complicated,
- often times inflicting some sort of additional effect.
- It sounds like your intelligence determines the potency 
- of status effects and accuracy of magical attacks.
- Whether to avoid magic and crowd control, 
- or, on the other hand, make them easier to cast, 
- it's easier with higher intelligence."
- 
- -18F-
- 
- "Hm?"　There was something fallen on the ground.
- Picking it up, 
- I saw that it was a playing card.
- The queen of hearts.
- 
- ?:
- "Do you know the meaning of that card?"
- 
- The sudden voice 
- belonged to a young man,
- the timing of his arrival a mystery.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "You are...?"
- Young Man:
- "I'm Lucifer.
- How are you,
- (Protagonist Name)?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "!?"
- Lucifer:
- "If you're wondering why I know about you, 
- well, 
- aren't tales of your exploits all the rage right now?
- The more you break through these floors, 
- the more attention you're going to get, you know.
- ... Rather that that, 
- let's talk about the card.
- You see, the queen of hearts...
- is kind, delicate, and full of love.
- Yet...
- She's also irresolute, unable to come to any decision.
- Those are the qualities she reveals.
- Just like her."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Her...?"
- Lucifer:
- "Yeah, her.
- ... I'm talking about Lilith."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "!"
- Lucifer:
- "Though filled with a deep love, 
- she has no control
- over her own existence.
- That...
- lies within your hands."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Me?　What do you mean...?"
- Lucifer:
- "I mean exactly that.
- Your choices alone
- will determine her fate.
- That's why you should think well before you act.
- With a simple thought,
- the existence known as Lilith will be set in stone."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "So you're saying...
- I may be able 
- to save her?"
- Lucifer:
- "Oh,　who knows.
- That's up to you, isn't it?
- Now, that about wraps things up.
- ... send my regards to Lilith."
- Hehehe..."
- 
- Lucifer chuckled, then
- departed for somewhere.
- He was a strange man.
- As I looked at that card in my hand, suddenly, 
- the picture started changing.
- Before long,
- it had become a queen of spades.
- 
- -17F-
- 
- Lilith:
- "(Protagonist Name)..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Lilith, huh."
- Lilith:
- "......"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Do you finally feel like
- telling me the truth?"
- 
- A look of hesitation 
- hung on her face.
- She looked away.
- What lay there wasn't a demon or anything, 
- but a lone woman. 
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "It's fine if you 
- don't want to talk, but...
- if you're really (Heroine Name), then that means...
- for my sake, 
- you turned into a demon. "
- Lilith:
- "Just like that..
- you always try to take responsibility..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "!"
- Lilith:
- "I won't keep running away from my choices.
- No matter how harsh they may be..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "L-Lilith...
- no...
- (Heroine Name)..."
- Lilith:
- "I'm...
- ...ugh-"
- 
- Suddenly, her expression shifted.
- 
- Lilith:
- "Aa...
- Aaah...!
- (Protagonist Name):
- "What's wrong?!"
- Lilith:
- "Don't touch me,
- human!"
- 
- Lilith yelled
- with abrupt intensity.
- Suddenly, a flash of light illuminated the air, 
- followed by the descent of darkness.
- A man clad in solid shadow
- had appeared next to Lilith.
- 
- Man:
- "Feeble being, human be thy name...
- Lilith.
- I thought I told you to throw away
- that useless compassion."
- Lilith:
- "Please forgive me, Lord Satan."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Who the hell are you supposed to be?"
- Man:
- "I ask that you refrain from such
- uncouth behavior towards me.
- I am Satan,
- ruler of all demons."
- Then...
- 
- The man brought Lilith close, 
- his hand gripped around her waist.
- 
- Satan:
- "Come, say it, Lilith.
- Say who I am."
- Lilith:
- "My...
- ...master...
- Lord Satan."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "!?"
- Satan:
- "Just so.
- I was the one to contract with you, 
- granting you new life as a demon.
- Every single thing about you
- belongs to me."
- Lilith:
- "Yes, Lord Satan."
- Satan:
- "Well, that's how it is, young man.
- Do you understand?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "You...
- just what did you do to her...?!"
- Satan:
- "We're leaving, Lilith.
- You can't keep getting involved
- with the likes of humans forever."
- Lilith:
- "Yes, Lord Satan."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Wait!"
- 
- Lilith didn't even spare me a glance.
- Satisfied, Satan wrapped his hand around her shoulder.
- Then, the pair of demons
- melded into the dark and disappeared.
- 
- -16F-
- 
- A group of Sirens cut through the air, 
- diving towards me in quick succession.
- Though beautiful women at first glance, 
- their faces hid merciless, inhuman smiles.
- 
- Siren 1:
- "So you're the human that's been
- breaking through these floors one after the other, huh."
- Siren 2:
- "It must've been hard to come this far.
- Could it be you're also thinking of breaking through here?"
- Siren 3:
- "Well, it's fine.
- You'll be dying here in any case, after all."
- Siren 1:
- "Come, let me sing you
- a lullaby for your soul...!"
- 
- Three Flight Sirens appeared.
- 
- Thud
- Devoid of any strength, the last of the Sirens collapsed...
- It seemed I had safely gotten through the encounter.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "...Hm?"
- 
- Looking around me, 
- I spotted a heap of objects lying in the corner of the room.
- It was probably the Sirens' collection.
- After wondering if I should search for anything usable, 
- I noisily shuffled through the pile.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Oh? This is..."
- 
- A captivating blade was emanating a calm glow.
- They say birds like shiny objects, but
- there was no way I expected them to have gotten a hold of that.
- (You obtained the Grass-Cutting Sword)
- Graciously accepting this gift, 
- I departed, sword in hand.
