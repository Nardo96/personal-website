# Chapter 4
- -14F-
- 
-  Bartender:
- "I hear there's a lot of brawny,
- powerful demons loitering about.
- It'll get harder to effectively damage 
- opponents if they have higher vitality than you, 
- so if it's looking to be long, drawn out fight,
- consider raising your vitality.
- 
- -8F-
- 
- The room was arranged with
- various types of opulent fixings, and
- a chandelier hung from the ceiling, 
- illuminating the sculptures and paintings
- adorning the space.
- With a casual glance, 
- I saw the room's inhabitant
- spread atop an extravagant, 
- cabriole-legged sofa.
- ... She must have been
- a lady fit
- for this lavish room.
- Alas, she had long 
- turned into
- a dessicated mummy.
- The only clues to her gender
- were her dress and hair, 
- her face nothing more
- than wilted skin 
- on skull.
- Could this also have been
- a demon's victim?
- The dress the woman was wearing looked expensive, 
- sporting an elegant, prominent design,
- the fabric still retaining its luster.
- It seemed like it would looked good on Lilith...
- Casually, 
- that abrupt thought brushed by my mind.
- 
- [Choose]
- �I'll give it to Lilith as a present.
- �Better to mourn her than do something as irreverent as that.
- �Looks like there's nothing else... I guess I'll leave.
- 
- When 'I'll give it to Lilith as a present' is chosen:
- It felt creepy considering it was a corpse's dress, but
- maybe that made it even more fitting 
- for Lilith's demonic self.
- More than anything else, it really suited her, 
- and it's not like the dead need any clothing, so, 
- better to have
- someone wear it, right?
- Yet,
- in trying to undress her,
- as I touched the mummy...
- as if weathering away, 
- the dress and mummy jointly
- crumbled and disappeared.
- I thought it was a shame, but seeing nothing else to do, 
- I left the room.
- 
- When 'Better to mourn her than to do something as irreverent as that' is - chosen:
- Just what kind of calamity
- had struck this woman?
- What kind of a person had she been...?
- With those thoughts at heart,
- I closed my eyes shut and prayed.
- Upon opening them,
- I was shocked by what lay in front of me.
- A beautiful woman
- was gently sleeping on the sofa.
- She seemed radiant
- with porcelain skin,
- a faint blush sneaking onto her cheeks,
- complimenting her faintly cherry lips.
- Soft, flaxen hair waved past,
- her long eyelashes dropping an alluring shadow.
- ... Or so I saw, for a brief instant.
- By the time I realized it, what lay there
- was a familiar mummy.
- Was that...
- ... a hallucination?
- After giving my respects to the dead once again,
- I left the room.
- 
- When 'Looks like there's nothing else...' is chosen:
- Something like a dress would only add bulk, 
- serving no purpose.
- Plus, I doubted Lilith would be too happy
- to wear something off of a corpse...
- Seeing nothing else in the room, 
- I saw no reason to stay, 
- so I left.
- 
- -7F-
- 
- Tall shelves
- divided the inside of the room,
- filled to the brim
- with books.
- A library, perhaps?
- As I walked between the racks, 
- I saw a single light
- at a nearby reading desk.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Lilith...?"
- 
- There she was.
- She seemed to be sleeping at the desk, 
- her head nuzzled on top of her arm,
- with a book spread out in front of her.
- Who would have thought
- that I'd meet Lilith at a place like that...
- ...
- 
- [Choose]
- �Sleeping out in a place like this can't be good for her.
- �I think I'll stay and watch for a while.
- �I wonder what she was reading...
- 
- When 'Sleeping out in a place like this can't be good for her.' is chosen:
- Sleeping out in a place like this couldn't be good for her.
- Though, I didn't know if
- demons could even catch colds...
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Lilith..."
- Lilith:
- "Nngh..."
- 
- I gently shook her awake.
- When Lilith opened her eyes...
- 
- Lilith:
- "!"
- 
- In shock, she bolted up, 
- closing shut the book that was on the desk.
- Then, with tome in hand, 
- she scurried away into the sea of bookshelves.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Lilith?!
- Hey! Wait up!"
- 
- I quickly chased after her,
- but she was nowhere to be seen.
- I wondered what she was reading.
- In any case, as always,
- I couldn't get a read on her...
- Oh well.
- I suspected we would meet again if we needed to.
- Seeing nothing else of note, 
- I left the library.
- 
- When "I think I'll stay and watch for a while." is chosen:
- I pulled over a nearby chair, sat down, 
- then peered at Lilith's sleeping face.
- She looked incredibly gentle, 
- as far from a demon as anything could appear.
- ... As I sat watching, 
- I felt a yearning, heartrending feeling
- gush forth...
- As if I'd seen
- something like this before...
- Right.
- I remembered watching as she slept next to me
- on that park bench, 
- lured by the thought
- of a sunlit nap.
- It should have been a recent memory, 
- but it seemed like something
- so long ago.
- Compared to then,
- everything had changed...
- Unable to bear looking any further,
- I left Lilith there
- and departed the library.
- 
- When 'I wonder what she was reading.' is chosen:
- I mused on what she had been reading.
- Wondering if the book
- had any information regarding
- demons or this building,
- quietly,
- I peeked over to look...
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "!"
- 
- Lilith suddenly opened her eyes, waking up
- from the desk and closing the book shut.
- Then, 
- with tome in hand, 
- she scampered away behind the shelves.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Lilith?!
- Hey! Wait up!"
- 
- I quickly chased after her,
- but she was nowhere to be seen.
- Just what could she have been reading?
- In any case, she was as hard to read as ever...
- Oh well.
- I suspected we would meet again if we needed to.
- Seeing nothing else of note, 
- I left the library.
- 
- -6F-
- 
- "What's this place?"
- Grotesquely shaped plants thickly covered the center of the room, 
- with countless insects I had never seen before crawling about.
- Without thinking, I stiffened up
- at the ghastly sight in front of me.
- On cue, the insects slithering about the ground starting gathering in one - spot, 
- emanating a terrible, otherworldly sound.
- They were fervently eating something.
- ... Each other?
- That's right, they were cannibalizing each other!
- As they did so,
- the collection of bugs packed on mass,
- becoming bigger and bigger.
- What finally appeared
- was the agglutination of countless reptiles, insects, and such.
- It was a monstrous creature I had never seen before.
- 
- ?:
- "I am Bael, 
- an ancient god scorned by heaven.
- Now is the time of my vengeance!
- Humans, blessed by God!
- No one! Not a single one...
- Will survive!
- Die!!
- I'll kill you!!
- Urgh...
- DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE!!"
- 
- What's wrong with this guy?!
- Why was he 
- taking it out on me?!
- 
- Three Tyrant Bael appeared.
- 
- Bael:
- "--Again!
- Thwarted again by the schemes of heaven!
- You're nothing but a ****!!
- Damn it!
- Damn it all!!!"
- 
- Accompanied by an awful, unearthly sound, 
- the mass of monsters crumbled and disappeared.
- Seeing that I had safely gotten through the encounter,
- I took a breath in relief.
- 
- ?:
- "Looks like you're safe."
- 
- That moment,
- a voice suddenly came from the side.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Lilith?"
- 
- Turning around to look, 
- I saw that Lilith had been standing there since some point.
- 
- Lilith:
- "The guard this time around wasn't easy.
- I thought I'd drop by just in case, but
- it looks like that wasn't necessary."
- 
- Her deep, somber eyes
- reflecting a clever glint, 
- she seemed the usual, unreadable demon Lilith,
- but somehow,
- I thought it seemed like
- she had on an expression of relief.
- Or was that just my own wishful thinking?
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "I may look like this, but it was a hard fight.
- I totally thought I'd die."
- Lilith:
- "You keeping getting stronger day after day.
- The demons probably won't sit back and do nothing."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Looks like all that hard work's made me popular...
- I don't think I have enough lives.
- So, what did you drop by for this time?
- I doubt you only came to congratulate me, right?"
- Lilith:
- "I came to warn you.
- You..."
- Proceedings will change according to the protagonist's alignment
- 
- If the protagonist's alignment is LAW:
- "You're a kind, deeply compassionate man.
- But, in being so,
- you'll end up being used by the angels.
- They wish only to exploit your power."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Lilith... No, (Heroine Name)...
- Don't you also
- want to use me?"
- Lilith:
- "Hehe...
- You might be right.
- But I exist for your sake.
- I am what you wish me to be.
- Don't forget that..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "(Heroine Name)..."
- Lilith:
- "Take this."
- 
- You obtained an Incense of Wisdom!
- You obtained an Incense of Vitality!
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "This is...?"
- Lilith:
- "This is a magical incense that will spring forth power when you light it.
- It should definitely help you in your coming battles."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Thanks.
- This isn't a trap, right?"
- Lilith:
- "I prepared it just for you.
- I hope you can believe me."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Alright, I'll take it.
- Thanks."
- Lilith:
- "Then, I'll go on ahead.
- Please do be careful."
- 
- Leaving those words,
- soundlessly, she disappeared into darkness.
- 
- If the protagonist's alignment is NEUTRAL:
- "You always decide things by yourself.
- But, in doing so,
- you'll end up alone.
- Now that the world's like this, 
- humans have to cling to something
- to survive."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Lilith... No, (Heroine Name)...
- Humans are always alone.
- Even if they do rely on something."
- Lilith:
- "Hehe...
- You might be right.
- But I exist for your sake.
- I live precisely because you want me to.
- Don't forget that..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "(Heroine Name)..."
- Lilith:
- "Take this."
- 
- You obtained an Incense of Strength!
- You obtained an Incense of Agility!
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "This is...?"
- Lilith:
- "It's a magical incense that will spring forth power when you light it.
- It should definitely help you in your coming battles."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Alright, I'll take it.
- Thanks."
- Lilith:
- "Then, I'll go on ahead.
- Please do be careful."
- 
- Leaving those words,
- soundlessly, she disappeared into darkness.
- 
- If the protagonist's alignment is CHAOS:
- "You're honest to your own emotions.
- But, in being so, 
- you'll end up being used by the demons.
- I don't want to hand you over
- to anyone else."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Lilith... No, (Heroine Name)...
- I feel the same.
- I want to always be with you."
- Lilith:
- "Hehe...
- I'm glad.
- But, now's not the time for that yet.
- To win it all, 
- you'll need more power..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "(Heroine Name)..."
- Lilith:
- "Take this."
- 
- You obtained an Incense of Magic!
- You obtained an Incense of Strength!
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "This is...?"
- Lilith:
- "It's a magical incense that will spring forth power when you light it.
- It should definitely help you in your coming battles."
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Alright, I'll take it.
- Thanks."
- Lilith:
- "Then, I'll go on ahead.
- Please do be careful."
- 
- Leaving those words,
- soundlessly, she disappeared into darkness.
