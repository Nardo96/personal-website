{
- (Protagonist Name):
- "...nngh.."
- 
- Opening my eyes, I awoke 
- on an unfamiliar bed.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Where...
- just what happened?"
- Man:
- "Oh, you've woken up?
- I thought you were a goner, 
- but I suppose that's youth for you."
- 
- A young man stood there,
- clad in white robes and the stench of medicine. The bed I was placed on
- seemed to be the sort you'd find at a doctor's office.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Just what...?
- right...
- something blew up, and then..."
- Man:
- "For now, calm down.
- You were one of the few
- to narrowly survive that tragedy.
- Same as us.
- By fluke, 
- we happened to be in the building, 
- and hence, managed to survive.
- Those who remain
- are huddled up in this camp."
- 
- My memories were slow to stir.
- Right. While aimlessly wandering 
- god knows where, eventually, 
- I collapsed.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "You saved me?"
- Man:
- "Of course.
- Couldn't just leave you, could I?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "My girlfriend..."
- Man:
- "Who?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "There was a girl who 
- came here with me...... "
- Man:
- "Sorry, we found you alone...
- you were together with someone?
- What was her name?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Her name was..."
- Register Name: HEROINE
- (Enter Heroine Name)
- 
- Man:
- "(Heroine Name), is it?
- Well, hopefully she's found..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Right..."
- 
- I couldn't say anything more
- towards that worried face.
- She was undoubtedly dead.
- Like a flashback, I recalled
- her bloody figure.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "(Heroine Name)..."
- The man bumped my shoulder.
- Man:
- "This probably isn't much of a consolation, but 
- everyone is more or less
- in the same boat.
- Rest, for now. It's... probably best
- not to think about her too much."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "... Right...
- ......
- ... thanks..."
- 
- He left the office.
- I lay face up on the bed and closed my eyes
- as various things circled around in my mind.
- Her face.
- That flash of light.
- The reason that
- all of this happened.
- But I had no way of knowing more.
- Moreover, 
- it seemed my body hadn't fully healed yet.
- Before I knew it, 
- I had begun drifting off to sleep...
- 
- Voice:
- "(Protagonist Name)... (Protagonist Name)..."
- 
- I thought I heard a voice calling out.
- One I had heard before.
- It was someone I was intimately familiar with...
- 
- Voice:
- "(Protagonist Name)... (Protagonist Name)..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "...!"
- 
- With a gasp, I was startled awake.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "(Heroine Name)."
- 
- There she was, 
- standing in the corner of that dark room, 
- a muffled giggle slipping past her lips.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "No, wait...
- ... who are you?"
- 
- What stood there was not (Heroine Name). 
- She was gone now.
- As a sense of loss began filling my chest once more, 
- with a heavy heart, 
- I laid my eyes upon the woman in front of me.
- She was undeniably beautiful.
- I couldn't tell her age, exactly.
- At a glance, she seemed to be around my age, 
- but she was tinged with a mature charm.
- 
- Woman:
- "My name is Lilith."
- 
- Her voice, in the end, 
- somehow gave me a sense of longing.
- Just what was this feeling?
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Are you also... with the camp?"
- Lilith:
- "No, not quite."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "......?　Then...?"
- Lilith:
- "Rather than me, 
- let's talk about you."
- 
- Lilith laughed, then 
- quickly made her way down to the bed.
- Whether from those graceful limbs or supple movements, 
- she gave off the air of a fickle tabby.
- 
- Lilith:
- "Don't you wanna leave?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "From this camp?"
- Lilith:
- "From this building.
- Since you don't know, I'll tell you.
- Right now, this entire building is 
- a demon's nest."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "D-Demon?!"
- Lilith:
- "Yup.
- That's why no one
- can get out of here."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "That's..."
- 
- It was hard to take her at face value. But after what just happened, 
- it seemed that 
- anything was possible. 
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "So that's it.
- But...
- what does it matter?"
- Lilith:
- "Eh?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "It's fine even if I don't go, 
- isn't it?
- Those guys told me it was 
- okay to stay, too."
- 
- Right.
- There was no reason to go out of my way
- to step into a demon's lair.
- 
- Lilith:
- "Are you really fine with that?"
- 
- Suddenly, her hand touched me.
- In that instant, I was overcome with a mysterious sensation.
- What in the world?
- I felt like she knew something
- about my girlfriend, after all..."
- 
- Lilith:
- "Are you just going to stay here, 
- waiting for it all to pass?
- Don't you have
- somewhere to be?"
- 
- Ridiculous.
- By that point, 
- I had lost everything.
- My theretofore peaceful lifestyle, 
- my mundane daily life, my hopes for the future, 
- and my ties from the past.
- Everything was blasted away in an instant.
- Only emptiness remained.
- 
- Lilith:
- "You haven't lost anything yet."
- 
- She spoke like
- she had seen through me.
- 
- Lilith:
- "But you just may,
- if you continue hesitating.
- You can have it all back, if you so desire."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Hold on...
- are you talking about (Heroine Name)?
- No way...
- She's alive...?!"
- Lilith:
- "......"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "What?
- Say something.
- What do you know?
- Just who the hell are you?"
- Lilith:
- "You, yourself,
- must find the answers you seek."
- 
- She spoke as if posing a riddle.
- Those eyes, 
- which seemed to look towards me with care, 
- lit up with an ominous glint.
- Her crimson lips broke out in a smile.
- 
- Lilith:
- "Hey...
- don't you want to know how?"
- 
- Lilith brought her body so close
- I could feel her temperature,
- her breath whispering by my ears.
- 
- Lilith:
- "I, at least, 
- can teach you." She giggled.
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Then teach me.
- What are you telling me to do?"
- Lilith:
- "Escape from this building."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "But isn't it supposed to be crawling with demons out there?"
- Lilith:
- "That's right.
- I wouldn't worry too much, though, with what you're holding." 
- 
- She talked in a hum, 
- seemingly in trance.
- 
- Lilith:
- "That is to say, 
- that Demon Summoning Program you received."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Eh?"
- Oh right, 
- that thing that got sent to my phone...!"
- Lilith:
- "Yup.
- So long as you have that application, 
- you can take demons along as allies.
- Allied demons will
- fight your enemies alongside you.
- With their power, 
- you may be able to break out of here.
- ... Now, open the app.
- Choose your first demon..."
- 
- Demon Selection
- Please choose the first demon 
- you'd like to ally with.
- Pixie / Fairy / Lv 2 / NEUTRAL
- Knocker / Jirae / Lv  4 / LAW
- War Dog / Beastman / Lv 5 / NEUTRAL
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "This...
- allied demons, huh...
- I should be able to get out of here with this."
- Lilith:
- "If you use it well.
- Regardless, there's no point in charging out all of a sudden.
- There are some rather strong demons out there...
- Plus, you don't know anything about this building, 
- do you?
- First thing's first: 
- go around camp and gather more information.
- Also,
- this is Magnetite (MAG).
- Demons need this to maintain
- their forms in the human world."
- (You obtained 3000 MAG)
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Alright...
- understood."
- 
- I obediently nodded my head, 
- prompting Lilith to give me a satisfied smile.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "...... I'll ask once again, but 
- just who are you?
- Why'd you show me how to use this app?"
- Lilith:
- "Hmm, I wonder why. "
- (Protagonist Name):
- "......
- Whatever.
- For now, you have my thanks.
- What are you going to do now?"
- Lilith:
- "I can't go with you.
- But...
- we will surely meet again."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "What do you mean...?"
- Lilith:
- "You'll understand eventually...
- eventually..."
- 
- Leaving only the sound of laughter, 
- Lilith appeared to
- melt into the dark.
- It was like I'd been dreaming.
- Nevertheless, the Demon Summoning Program was
- definitely working.
- Though I didn't understand her objective, at the very least, 
- she had certainly given me the impetus I needed
-  to act.
- "First, I should try
- walking around camp, like she said."
- 
- -35F-
- 
- Bartender:
- Before defeating the Furies:
- "If you're really going to go downstairs, 
- you should stock up on equipment."
- After defeating the Furies:
- "What?!
- You really made it downstairs?!
- Y-You're amazing!"
- 
- -31F-
- 
- Voice:
- "(Protagonist Name)."
- 
- All of a sudden, I heard my name, so I stopped.
- From the shadows came none other than...
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Lilith!"
- Lilith:
- "Hello again.
- Why so shocked?
- I said it, didn't I?
- That we'd meet again."
- She laughed.
- 
- Just like last time,
- it was flush with a feline charm.
- 
- Lilith:
- "You did well in getting here.
- Have you gotten used to dealing with demons?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Yeah. Honestly, it feels pretty good.
- I managed to come this far with their help.
- Or...
- maybe it's all been thanks to you."
- Lilith:
- "Really?
- Ultimately, you were the one to act."
- 
- Having said that, Lilith suddenly stared
- at me with a serious expression.
- 
- Lilith:
- "There's a sentry up ahead. 
- The demons have placed guards on each floor, 
- preventing any escape."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Looks that way."
- Lilith:
- "Are you going to go?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Hey, hey, 
- weren't you the one to tell me to 
- break out of here?"
- Lilith:
- "No,
- I'm confident I said it was your decision to make."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "......
- If there's nothing else, could you move over?
- I'm gonna beat this guard and move on."
- Lilith:
- "Be careful.
- You're about to face the Furies.
- Their brass wings can strike up a gale wind, 
- and their claws are poisonous to boot."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "You came here to tell me that?"
- 
- Lilith offered no response, instead touching my hand
- as if unwilling to part.
- 
- Lilith:
- "That's all I can tell you.
- The rest is up to you."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "You don't have to tell me twice.
- As for you..."
- 
- She quietly shook her head.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "We'll meet again, right...?"
- Lilith:
- "Probably...
- No, we'll definitely meet again...
- when it's needed..."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "I thought about it when we first met, but...
- you knew about me
- from the very beginning, didn't you?
- We...
- Have we met somewhere...?"
- 
- It seemed Lilith had no intention
- of speaking any further.
- I couldn't tell what was going on inside her head.
- 
- Lilith:
- "Please do be careful...
- These birds have made quite a mess of things."
- 
- Then, 
- her figure melted into the dark once more, 
- leaving behind only a gate.
- On the other side, the enemy
- lay waiting.
- 
- The room was stuffy
- and dimly lit.
- An inexplicable smell of incense
- wafted through the soured air.
- 
- Voice:
- "Oh?"
- 
- Suddenly, a loud voice came flying down,
- along with the beating of wings.
- 
- Voice:
- "A human?"
- Voice:
- "Did you say human?"
- Voice:
- "It's a human!　We got a human here!"
- 
- Voices echoed about, 
- followed by screeching laughter.
- Soon, grotesque creatures appeared, 
- mixtures of avian and man.
- Stiff plumes lined their wings, 
- shining with a metallic luster. Their torsos were statuesque, 
- cold, yet beautiful.
- Lilith's words came floating back up.
- 'You're about to face the Furies.'
- Those sharp talons
- certainly seemed furious.
- With cruel eyes, the crones shot towards me,
- leaving shrill laughter
- and inauspicious mutterings in their wake.
- 
- Furiae 1:
- "Human!
- Just where do you think you are?
- If you waltzed in here by accident..."
- Furiae 2:
- "In that case, we can let you off the hook, 
- after you leave behind an arm or two."
- Furiae 3:
- "He only really needs his legs, right?"
- The Furies:
- "Hahahahahahaha!"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Too bad, but I'm coming through."
- Furiae 1:
- "Did you hear that, sisters?"
- Furiae 2:
- "Oh, I heard.
- This human thinks he can just pass through here."
- Furiae 3:
- "Kid,
- if you're saying you stepped in here,
- knowing that it was the lair of us Furies, then..."
- Furiae 1:
- "You're not getting out of here alive!"
- 
- With raucous laughter, the Furies launched towards me,
- their metal wings dancing through the air.
- 
- Furiae 2:
- "I never thought I'd get to meet
- a human quite like this...!"
- Furiae 3:
- "Punk!
- Looks like you're not afraid of demons, huh?"
- Furiae 1:
- "Your body's about to be 
- taught a sharp lesson!"
- Furiae 2:
- "Rip his entrails out!"
- Furiae 3:
- "We're eating meat tonight!"
- The Furies:
- "Hahahahahahaha!"
- 
- Three Furiae appeared.
- 
- The last Furiae collapsed.
- Across fluttering feathers,
- I could see a gaping doorway.
- One way or another, it seemed like I could 
- get down to the next floor.
- Yet, I was still high up in the building.
- Further down, there would surely be 
- stronger foes lying in wait...
- 
- -30F-
- 
- Bartender:
- Before defeating Lilith:
- "We can hardly do a thing about 
- the demon guarding the 26th  floor...
- Hell.. no matter which floor you look in,
- they're all crawling with demons."
- After defeating Lilith:
- "You beat the guard?!
- Looks like we can start heading down... Go on and drink up, 
- it's on the house!"
- 
- -26F-
- 
- Lilith:
- "How are you feeling?"
- 
- Suddenly, Lilith appeared.
- Her visits were always abrupt.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Lilith, huh....
- you're all over the place."
- Lilith:
- "Hehe.
- I'll go anywhere, 
- if you're there."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "So, you're free to 
- move about this building, then.
- Can you also go outside?"
- Lilith:
- "Oh? Why do you wanna know?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "I just...
- wanted to know what was happening out there."
- Lilith:
- "That's something
- you should find out by yourself."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "I thought you'd say that."
- Lilith:
- "Hehe."
- 
- Lilith's manner, 
- capricious as it was, 
- seemed also tinged
- with something of a caring aura.
- Like she was protecting me,
- guiding me...
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "So?
- Since you're here, 
- you have something to say, right?"
- Lilith:
- "That's right.
- You'd better be careful
- if you're gonna go down this path."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "!?
- You mean..."
- Lilith:
- "Yup.
- There's a guard up ahead. 
- A group of Yoma Lilim
- is eagerly awaiting your arrival.
- Creatures of the night, they chant songs of darkness -
- be careful of their voices.
- I pray for your success.
- Until we meet again."
- 
- She left the way she came, 
- disappearing into the air.
- 
- The room was pitch-black.
- Yet,
- seemingly with my one-step intrusion as a signal, 
- in the darkness, flames roared to life.
- Candle flames.
- One by one, any number of candles lit up, 
- throwing off an eerie glow.
- I hazily began to sense a presence within...
- The sound of giggling 
- filled the air.
- By the time I realized it,
- a group of Yoma, in the forms of innocent young girls, 
- had surrounded me!
- 
- Three Yoma Lilim appeared.
- 
- -25F-
- 
- Bartender:
- "You came from upstairs?
- Impressive.
- Do you think you could also
- take care of a monster on the 21st  floor for me?"
- 
- -23F-
- 
- A thick screen of tobacco smoke
- hung widely in the air.
- For the first time in a while, 
- I thought I heard the boisterous sounds
- of catcalls and laughter.
- But, 
- rather than from happiness, 
- that empty noise came from a need
- to drown out the fear and despair
- that lay in front of them.
- 
- Man:
- "Hey dude!
- You wanna join in?
- We don't have enough players."
- 
- The guys who called out to me
- seemed to be trying to play some sort of card game. 
- Littered around me were
- shady gambling tables, roulettes, 
- and the like.
- With screams of joy and sorrow as the background, 
- the masses drank and smoked themselves
- into pandemonium.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Oh boy. I don't think I'll manage to get any real info, 
- at this rate."
- As I turned to leave, 
- I heard a nearby drunkard
- mumble something out
- in a slur.
- 
- Drunkard:
- "Hey!
- I saw it!
- ... a horse...
- no, something more... mystical...
- the sentry...
- that...
- that was...."
- 
- After muttering one last time, the man drifted off to sleep, 
- and started snoring.
- Oh boy.
- 
- -21F-
- 
- Man in White:
- "Hey, you!"
- 
- A young man dressed in white
- came calling, neatly groomed, 
- his eyes carrying a 
- strong will.
- Though I felt
- a sort of oppressive dignity from him, 
- at the same time, 
- he seemed honest and straightfoward.
- 
- Man in White:
- "You're (Protagonist Name), right?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Do you know me?
- Who are you?"
- Man in White:
- "I came to give you some advice."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Advice?"
- Man in White:
- "Well,
- maybe I should call it a warning instead.
- It's about Lilith."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "You know her?!"
- Man in White:
- "She is a trap of fate, if you will, 
- meant to determine who you truly are."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "... Huh?"
- Man in White:
- "Put simply, 
- Lilith is a 
- temptress."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "So you're saying she's supposed to tempt me?
- ... Just who is she?"
- Man in White:
- "You already know, don't you?
- It's (Heroine Name), after all."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "...... Huh...?"
- Man in White:
- "As you know, 
- (Heroine Name) died."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "In the explosion..."
- Man in White:
- "Precisely.
- But just in that moment of death,
- she made a wish.
- She didn't want to leave you behind.
- Such a powerful, yet transient plea
- could not escape demonic eyes.
- Before long, between life and death, 
- a certain being murmured towards her.
- 'I don't mind letting you live,
- as a demon, that is.'"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "That's!
- ... Then...
- you're saying Lilith is..."
- Man in White:
- "(Heroine Name) sold her soul to demons, 
- and in doing so, was reborn as one."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "No!
- There's no way she's a demon!"
- Man in White:
- "What makes you so certain?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Because......
- she's...
- really nice, and..."
- Man in White:
- "It is precisely her kindness
- that made her deal with the devil.
- That, and her desire to be by your side,
- even at the pain of becoming a demon."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "That's...
- ... Then... she did all that... for me?"
- Man in White:
- "Yet her choice was mistaken.
- I'll say it again.
- She serves no purpose
- other than to be an alluring trap.
- Fate is ever-changing -
- everything depends on your decisions.
- You must walk the path of light.
- Henceforth,
- heed not the words
- of that woman."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Hold on, wait!"
- 
- Having said his part, he made to leave.
- I tried to chase after him, 
- but soon lost vision of him.
- It was a strange meeting,
- and an unbelievable story.
- Come to think of it,
- she and Lilith shared some commonalities.
- There was also that 
- familiar feeling back in the beginning...
- But, 
- why did he want me to ignore Lilith?
- Up until now, 
- she'd been giving me information about the enemy, 
- and that info had been correct.
- Even so, did he mean to imply that
- there was no guarantee I could trust 
- what she said from now on?
- It didn't look like I'd get an answer 
- just standing there.
- I wanted to see Lilith and figure it out myself.
- Maybe we could meet again
- if I aimed to challenge the next sentry...
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Lilith!"
- Lilith:
- "Looks like you're moving along rather well."
- (Protagonist Name):
- "This is the guard room, huh."
- Lilith:
- "Precisely.
- Ahead lies the sacred beast - "
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Before that, I've got something to ask you."
- Lilith:
- "What's that?"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Are you really (Heroine Name)?"
- Lilith:
- "...!"
- 
- Her expression paled,
- in sharp contrast to the teasing manner
- she had kept until then.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Well?"
- Lilith:
- "......"
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Why won't you talk?"
- Lilith:
- "I...
- ... I..."
- 
- Face pallid,
- she averted her eyes.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "So it's true?
- I can't believe it...
- You're... (Heroine Name)..."
- Lilith:
- "No!
- I'm...
- I'm...!"
- 
- Her lips trembled, 
- like she wanted to cry out her gushing thoughts, 
- but couldn't do so.
- And so,
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "H-Hey!"
- 
- As if running away,
- she disappeared.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "Lilith..."
- 
- That moment,
- a ghastly, otherwordly voice
- came haunting from across the passageway.
- It seemed the guard
- had gotten tired of waiting.
- 
- The sound of hooves crashing through the ground filled the air.
- Situated there
- was a horde of fantastical creatures.
- They seemed spirited, like stallions,
- heroic, like lions, 
- and graceful, like deer.
- And atop their heads lay a unicorn's horn.
- They brandished their horned heads, 
- and charged towards me.
- I hesistated at the thought of fighting 
- such seemingly holy beings.
- But, the herd had no intention of waiting for me to decide!
- 
- Three Holy Beast Kirin appeared.
- 
- "Gyyaaaaa--!!"
- The death throes of the last Holy Beast echoed about...
- It seemed I had gotten out of it safely.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "...hm?"
- 
- As I looked around me, 
- I spotted a man's corpse.
- This body, torn apart by the beasts, 
- was damaged beyond recognition.
- One wrong move and this might have been me...
- I felt my back grow cold with sweat.
- Looking closer, 
- I saw his hand holding a blade.
- 
- (Protagonist Name):
- "This... seems like a rather impressive sword."
- 
- As I took the blade, 
- its honed edge reflecting a dazzling light, 
- I realized that this was a masterwork.
- Thank you...
- At that moment, for reasons unknown to me, 
- the blade itself seemed to rejoice.
- Though I had just stolen from a dead man, 
- I felt as if the sword had wanted me to do it.
- Was this the so-called will these famed swords possessed?
- (You obtained Famed Sword Kotetsu!)
- Graciously accepting this gift, 
- I departed, sword in hand.
